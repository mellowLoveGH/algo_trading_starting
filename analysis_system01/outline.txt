quantitative trading strategies:

策略 1
	下跌 n%, 买入/补仓， 
	上涨 n%, 卖出/清仓

策略 2
	双均线， 金叉买入，死叉卖出
	(MA-P) / MA

策略 3
	因子选股， 如 市值、增长率、市盈率等

策略 4
	均值回归:
		arbitrage
		bollinger band
		动量策略/惯性 vs 反转策略/回归

策略 5
	PEG策略， 定价合理的话 市盈率与收益增长率相等
		PE = 股价 P / 每股收益 EPS, ~=市值/净收益
		收益增长率 G = ( EPS(i) - EPS(i-1) ) / EPS(i-1)
		PEG = PE / (G*100)
		> 1 卖出, < 1 买入 

策略 6
	羊驼交易法则：
		开始时 随机买入 N 支股票， 每天卖掉表现最差的 M 支， 再买入剩余股票池中最具潜力的 M 支 
		随机选股，周期调仓，根据收益率
		类似于 进化论，不断优化

1. Mean reversion
2. Trend following / momentum trading
3. Statistical arbitrage (based on on the theory of mean reversion)	
4. Algorithmic pattern recognition - front running
	build a model that can identify when a large institutional firm is going to make a large trade, 
	so you can trade against them. 
	It’s also sometimes known as high-tech front running.
5. Behavioural bias recognition - front running
	exploit the psychological quirks of retail investors
6. ETF rule trading - front running
	When a new stock is added to or substracted from an index,
	the ETFs representing that index often have to buy/sell that stock as well.
